#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a=12345678;
    char *r=(char *)&a;
    (*r==78)?printf("little endian"):printf("big endian");
    
}

explanation:
--> in th above program we are doing type casting from integer to char because we have to compare 1 byte of date 
-->if the starting byte contain last byte then it is called little endian other wise it is called big endian(as it is print)
